## Individual Poem Analyses

### Jesus Vazquez

**Poem Title:** New Wars
**Author:** Benjamin Griffith Brawley
**Magazine:** Colored American Magazine
**Issue Date:** v.1-2 (1900-1901)
**HathiTrust Link:** https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000053237019&seq=300&q1=Brawley

#### Search Process
- How I searched: I searched HathiTrust using the magazine title *Colored American Magazine* and narrowed results by year. I then used the search within text feature to search for the author's last name, Brawley.The poem appeared in the results and I navigated to the page to confirm it.
- Was it easy to find: Yes it was fairly easy to find after understanding how HathiTrust website worked.
- Challenge encountered: One challenge was that OCR search was not perfectly accurate, so some scrolling was required to verify the poem location.

#### OCR Observations
- OCR issue noticed: Some punctuation is faded out, and line spacing is not perfectly recognized in the OCR text.
- Another issue: Poetry formatting, especially line breaks and indentation, made OCR less reliable than with normal paragraphs.
- How this affects research: This could affect research because key word searches might miss poems or return incomplete results if OCR errors occur.

#### Context Comparison
- Context gained from original page: Seeing the original page showed that the poem appears as a part of a larger section in the magazine giving historical and editorial context.
- What the dataset removes: The dataset removes layout, typography, and surrounding material such as headings or nearby text.
- What the dataset makes easier: The dataset makes it easier to seach organize, and analyze poems across many different issues.
